# Google I/O 2013 Experiment

To build developer interest on the Google I/O 2013 website before conference registration opened, we developed a series of mobile-first experiments and games focusing on touch interactions, generative audio and the joy of discovery. Inspired by the potential of code and the power of play, this interactive experience begins with the simple sounds of "I" and "O" when you tap the new I/O logo.
